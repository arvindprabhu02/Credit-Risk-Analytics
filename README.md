# Financial Credit Risk Analytics

Finance Credit Risk Analytics

This project analyzes personal loan behavior to assess credit exposure and concentration risk in a retail banking portfolio. The analysis combines SQL-based segmentation, Python exploratory analysis, and an executive Tableau dashboard to support credit risk decision-making.

Business Problem

Retail banks must balance loan growth with credit risk control. This project aims to identify which customer segments drive personal loan exposure and whether current lending practices result in concentration risk.

Tools & Technologies

SQL: Portfolio-level metrics and customer segmentation
Python: Exploratory data analysis and diagnostic insights
Tableau: Executive dashboard for credit exposure monitoring

Key Insights

Personal loan penetration is low at 9.6%, indicating conservative overall credit exposure.
Over 90% of loan exposure is concentrated among high-income customers, highlighting income as the primary underwriting driver.
Education level reinforces this strategy, with higher loan uptake among graduate and professionally educated customers.
While default risk is contained, income-based exposure concentration introduces portfolio concentration risk.

Business Recommendations

Continue prioritizing income stability in credit approval decisions.
Actively monitor exposure concentration within high-income segments.
Explore selective expansion into well-screened middle-income customers to improve portfolio diversification.

Tableau Dashboard

The interactive dashboard is provided as a packaged Tableau workbook. Since GitHub does not render Tableau workbooks, screenshots have been added for clarity, including:
