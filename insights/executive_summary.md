Executive Summary – Credit Risk & Personal Loan Analysis

Objective

To evaluate personal loan exposure in a retail banking portfolio and identify concentration risks across customer segments.

Key Findings

Personal loan exposure is limited at the portfolio level, with only 9.6% of customers holding personal loans.
High-income customers account for the majority of loan exposure, creating a concentrated risk profile.
Education level acts as a reinforcing factor, with higher loan uptake among financially stable customer groups.

Strategic Implications

The bank’s lending strategy effectively limits default risk through selective underwriting.
Concentration within a narrow customer segment increases sensitivity to segment-specific economic shocks.
Diversification through controlled expansion into adjacent low-risk segments could improve portfolio resilience.
